Search and refer to W3School's website layout template to initially complete the page layout



Version 1 (1.5H):
Start to try to  convert the ISYS3004 Unit Outline to a SPA.

Encountered problem: 
      how to achieve left and right alignment in the header
      
Solution: 
      I tried the float and position layouts of the elements, and try to use column layouts. Found that the position layout is more suitable, but there is still a problem, that is, when the page is too narrow, the elements will cover each other. No solution has been found so far.



Version 2(2H):
Modified some page layouts; Convert page 1 and 2 of the ISYS3004 Unit Outline to html.

Encountered problem:
    Page 1 of Outline has a complex layout
    
Solution:
    Try different kinds of CSS formats, find that table is the easiest way to achieve.



Version 3(3H):
Modified some page layouts; Convert page 3-5 of the ISYS3004 Unit Outline to html.

  Encountered problem:
    1.How to insert image from local folder
    2.How to convert Bullet/Numbering to html style
    
  Solution:
    1. Use tag img src="*file address*"
    2. Use tag ul and ol which is easiert than use table
  
Version 3.1:
Try to deploy the website live, find image and style file was not loaded. Move style.css file out of css folder sovle this problem, but did not find how to problem of image.

  
Version 4(5H):
Modified some page layouts; Convert rest pages of the ISYS3004 Unit Outline to html.

Version 4.1:
Solve the problem about image can not loaded, File extension need to be same should not have different case(lower/upper)

Version 4.2(0.5H):
Implement page jumps by using navigation bar

The homework is done by myself, and the problems encountered are solved by learning the tutorials of W3School and referring to the open source projects on the Internet

Task of convert the ISYS3004 Unit Outline to a SPA has completed, totaly time spend: 12.5 hours.

Has Passed CSSValidation.
Html Checker shows that still have 12 errors, 9 of them are 'The __ attribute on the __ element is obsolete. Use CSS instead.' ,but for my personal idea: if some simple attribute for table/td element must change to use CSS, there will be more complex than current format, so I did not change it. The rest 3 are 'Bad value ___ for attribute ___ on element ___: Illegal character in scheme data: space is not allowed. (3)' 
I don't know how to solve it.
