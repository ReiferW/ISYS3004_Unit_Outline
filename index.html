        <h4>Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update</h4>
        <p>Curtin University is committed to supporting all our students and staff whether they are on campus, working 
            remotely or overseas. Your health, safety and wellbeing are our priority and the continuing COVID-19 pandemic 
            may require changes to the unit schedule, learning activities, delivery modes and assessment to provide flexible 
            and safe options to our community. Curtin will endeavour to keep changes and disruptions to a minimum at all 
            times. For current advice and further information visit <a href = "https://www.curtin.edu.au/novel-coronavirus/">

        <h4>Syllabus</h4>
        <p>
            The study of Web application development; examine web technologies, alternative web development methodologies and evaluate various code libraries and tools.
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>Students will develop and apply the skills necessary to design and implement business websites using appropriate 
            technologies in this unit. This technology includes using HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to define the 
            structure, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to determine the look and feel, JavaScript to provide a website's 
            behaviour, and other supporting technologies and frameworks to provide for a rich user experience in a business 
            context. Students will develop and apply professional skills in a web development environment to identify 
            stakeholder requirements and select and implement appropriate technologies for responsive and accessible web-based applications. 
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <h4>Unit Learning Outcomes</h4>
        <p>All graduates of Curtin University achieve a set of six Graduate Capabilities during their course of study. These 
            inform an employer that, through your studies, you have acquired discipline knowledge and a range of other skills
            and capabilities which employers would value in a professional setting. Each unit in your course addresses the 
            Graduate Capabilities through a clearly identified set of learning outcomes. They form a vital part in the process 
            referred to as assurance of learning. The learning outcomes notify you of what you are expected to know,
            understand or be able to do in order to be successful in this unit. Each assessment for this unit is carefully
            designed to test your knowledge of one or more of the unit learning outcomes. On successfully completing all of 
            the assessments you will have achieved all of these learning outcomes.
            Your course has been designed so that on graduating you will have achieved all of Curtin's Graduate Capabilities 
            through the assurance of learning processes in each unit.
