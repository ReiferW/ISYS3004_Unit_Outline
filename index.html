        <h4>Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update</h4>
        <p>Curtin University is committed to supporting all our students and staff whether they are on campus, working 
            remotely or overseas. Your health, safety and wellbeing are our priority and the continuing COVID-19 pandemic 
            may require changes to the unit schedule, learning activities, delivery modes and assessment to provide flexible 
            and safe options to our community. Curtin will endeavour to keep changes and disruptions to a minimum at all 
            times. For current advice and further information visit <a href = "https://www.curtin.edu.au/novel-coronavirus/">

        <h4>Syllabus</h4>
        <p>
            The study of Web application development; examine web technologies, alternative web development methodologies and evaluate various code libraries and tools.
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>Students will develop and apply the skills necessary to design and implement business websites using appropriate 
            technologies in this unit. This technology includes using HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to define the 
            structure, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to determine the look and feel, JavaScript to provide a website's 
            behaviour, and other supporting technologies and frameworks to provide for a rich user experience in a business 
            context. Students will develop and apply professional skills in a web development environment to identify 
            stakeholder requirements and select and implement appropriate technologies for responsive and accessible web-based applications. 
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <h4>Unit Learning Outcomes</h4>
        <p>All graduates of Curtin University achieve a set of six Graduate Capabilities during their course of study. These 
            inform an employer that, through your studies, you have acquired discipline knowledge and a range of other skills
            and capabilities which employers would value in a professional setting. Each unit in your course addresses the 
            Graduate Capabilities through a clearly identified set of learning outcomes. They form a vital part in the process 
            referred to as assurance of learning. The learning outcomes notify you of what you are expected to know,
            understand or be able to do in order to be successful in this unit. Each assessment for this unit is carefully
            designed to test your knowledge of one or more of the unit learning outcomes. On successfully completing all of 
            the assessments you will have achieved all of these learning outcomes.
            Your course has been designed so that on graduating you will have achieved all of Curtin's Graduate Capabilities 
            through the assurance of learning processes in each unit.

        <h4>Learning Activities</h4>
        <p>These learning activities in this unit include a mixture of reading, website study, watching videos, quizzes and other 
            online activities that enable students to self-test their understanding. Some activities will be story-lined; that is 
            must complete one activity before progressing. Students undertake other hands-on activities during weekly 
            workshops, interspersed with short lectures. Partial model solutions to some activities will be available on 
            Blackboard. Preparatory and workshop activities are on the Blackboard site.

        <h4>Assessment Moderation</h4>
        <h5>Fair assessment through moderation</h5>
        <p>
            Moderation describes a quality assurance process to ensure that assessments are appropriate to the learning 
            outcomes, and that students work is evaluated consistently by assessors. Minimum standards for the moderation 
            of assessments are described in the Assessment and Student Progression Manual, available from
            <a href="https://policies.curtin.edu.au/findapolicy/">policies.curtin.edu.au/findapolicy/</a>
        </p>
        <h5>Pre-marking moderation</h5>
        <p>
            A co-assessor is assigned to this unit to review all assessment tasks and marking criteria/rubrics and monitor and 
            confirm the integrity of results. Assessment tasks are provided to students before the assessment task, marking 
            criteria are provided to students, assessors are provided with marking guides/rubrics and sufficient information to 
            ensure fair and consistent evaluation of student work.
